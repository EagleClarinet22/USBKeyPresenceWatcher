Automatically lock your Windows session when your selected **USB device** (security key, token, or any USB hardware you choose) is removed — and keep the system locked until that device is reinserted.

This project includes:

- A PowerShell presence watcher
- Toast notifications via BurntToast (optional)
- A Windows Scheduled Task to start the watcher automatically
- Event Viewer logging (with file fallback)
- A fully interactive **installer** that detects your USB devices
- A matching **uninstaller**
- A clean, self-elevating installation workflow
- **GitHub Actions pipelines** validating XML, linting PowerShell, and generating releases
- **Issue templates + Discussions** for structured reporting and community support

> ⚠️ This script must run using **Windows PowerShell 5.1** (the built-in Windows PowerShell).  
> PowerShell 7+ (pwsh.exe) is **not supported** for hidden scheduled-task execution, PnP APIs, or BurntToast.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Presence-based security

Locks your workstation automatically when your selected USB device disappears — and keeps it locked until the device returns.

### 🔁 Persistent lock enforcement

If the system is manually unlocked while the USB device is missing, the watcher immediately locks it again.

### 🔔 Toast notifications (optional)

Requires BurntToast. Indicates:

- Monitoring started
- Device removed
- Device reinserted

### 🧱 Hub-resilience

Prevents false positives from USB hub glitches (default: **2 consecutive misses** required to lock).

### 🗂 Automatic Event Viewer logging

Log: **Application**  
Source: **USBKeyPresenceWatcher**

### 🧩 Smart installer workflow

The installer:

- Detects all USB devices with VID/PID
- Lets you choose the correct USB device or token
- Patches the installed script with your VID/PID
- Hardens directory ACLs
- Creates the EventLog source
- Generates runtime task XML:

```
Template-USBKeyPresenceLock.xml → Task-USBKeyPresenceLock.xml
```

### 🔒 Secure installation directory

The installer grants FullControl to:

- Current user
- SYSTEM
- Administrators

All others are removed.

# ⚙ How It Works Internally

### 1. **Task Scheduler Startup**

The installer registers a task that runs at:

- User logon
- Session unlock

The task executes:

```
wscript.exe Launch-USBKeyPresenceWatcher.vbs
```

The VBS wrapper silently launches:

```
powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -File USBKeyPresenceLock.ps1
```

This ensures **fully hidden execution**.

---

### 2. **USB Device Detection**

Once per second:

```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -PresentOnly | Where-Object InstanceId -like "*VID_####&PID_####*"
```

- Missing device → increment counter
- Present device → reset counter
- After N misses → lock workstation

---

### 3. **Locking Logic**

```powershell
rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation
```

Optional heartbeat logs help diagnose issues.

---

### 4. **Single Instance Control**

A mutex prevents duplicate watchers:

```
USBKeyPresenceWatcher_<USERNAME>
```

---

### 5. **Event Logging + Toast Notifications**

Logs go to Event Viewer or a fallback local log file.  
Toast notifications appear if BurntToast is installed.

---

### 6. **Uninstallation**

The uninstaller:

- Terminates watcher instances
- Removes the scheduled task
- Deletes the installation directory
- Supports `-WhatIf`

Ensures complete cleanup.

---

# 🔧 Core Scripts

### `Install-USBKeyPresenceWatcher.ps1`

Handles:

- Selecting USB device
- Patching watcher with VID/PID
- Hardening ACLs
- Generating task XML
- Registering the task

---

### `Uninstall-USBKeyPresenceWatcher.ps1`

Handles:

- Killing watcher processes
- Removing scheduled task
- Cleaning directories
- Supporting dry runs with `-WhatIf`

---

### `USBKeyPresenceLock.ps1`

The core watcher:

- Polls for device
- Enforces lock-on-missing
- Logs events
- Sends notifications
- Prevents multiple instances

---

### `Launch-USBKeyPresenceWatcher.vbs`

Ensures the watcher runs:

- Hidden
- Under correct session
- Without console windows

---

### `Template-USBKeyPresenceLock.xml`

Defines triggers, actions, permissions, and runtime environment.

### Adjust hub-resilience threshold

```powershell
$missingThreshold = 2
```

# ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Expand FAQ</strong></summary>

### Do I need VID/PID?

No — the installer detects everything.

### Does this replace authentication?

No — this adds presence-based locking only.

### Does this work with Windows Hello?

Yes.

### Why Windows PowerShell 5.1?

Required for PnP APIs, BurntToast, and hidden scheduled-task execution.

</details>

---

# 🛠 Troubleshooting

### No toast notifications?

Install BurntToast:

```powershell
Install-Module BurntToast -Scope CurrentUser
```

Ensure:

- Task runs as logged-in user
- "Run only when user is logged on" is enabled

---

# 🧹 Uninstallation

```powershell
.\Uninstall-USBKeyPresenceWatcher.ps1
```

Supports:

- Instance cleanup
- Task removal
- Directory deletion
- `-WhatIf`
